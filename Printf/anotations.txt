MAKEFILE
- No relink on header file (wrong INCL declaration)

PROTECTION
- Unmanaged cases where write fails (return values)
- Needs more protection on this specific cases and leave the program

FUNCTIONS
- Maybe numeric functions (decimal, base...) can be more elegant.
	-> (For example: join functions into one for a code reduction).
